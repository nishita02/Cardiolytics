Following are the links to the markdown files of various ML models used to predict the risk of heart attack in patients along with a complete explanation:

* [Logistic Regression on heart dataset](./Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Heart%20Dataset/Logistic%20Regression.md)
* [KNN on heart dataset](./KNN%20-%20heart%20dataset/KNN%20markdown.md)
* [SVM on heart dataset](./SVM%20-%20heart%20dataset/SVM%20markdown.md)
* [Naive Bayes on heart dataset](./Naive%20Bayes%20-%20Heart%20Dataset/Naive%20Bayes.md)
* [Decision Tree Classification on heart dataset](./Decision%20Tree%20-%20Heart%20Dataset/Decision%20Tree.md)
* [Random Forest on heart dataset](./Random%20Forest%20-%20heart%20dataset/Random%20Forest%20markdown.md)

Following is the link to the dashboard I created that summarizes all that we learned from our analysis:

* [What did we learn?](./What%20did%20we%20learn.pdf)

After proper evaluation, we can conclude that SVM proved to be the best-suited model for our dataset. This tells us that we have a clear margin of separation in between the classes. Also, SVM is more effective with high-dimensional data and small datasets.
